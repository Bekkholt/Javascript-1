# Javascript 1 - CA

This is my course assignment for Javascript 1.

## Description

I have used the Wizard World API, found in one of the lists that were linked to in this course. I chose to show the houses and their different properties. The main ones is shown on the index page, and the others on the details page. There is also a contact page with a form, which was a requirement for this CA.

## Further comments

The overall design and styling is made quite simple, since I want the focus to be on the javascript.
